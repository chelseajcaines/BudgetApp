# BudgetAppOne-2ndAttempt

Second attempt at building a simple budget app

Areas where I am having trouble: - error messages hiding properly, popping into view/becoming visabe when prompted properly - thinking that it must have gotten mucked up from me renaming everything to my liking again - got a litle jumbled with styling the headings, probably should use classes to help seperate them - line 89 in html, not sure why she used flex-space the way she did, thought that was something use in css - unable to get my icons to appear properly, but the buttons for them are there and they work - line 92, 96, & 100, is she using span so that way the '0' will line up with the center of the <p> line located aboove each span line respectfully? - line 155 on css, not sure what she doing there with @media - failed to use suggested formatting :(
